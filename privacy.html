        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: December 20, 2025</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how the Airtable Lead Enricher extension ("Extension", "we", "our") handles your information. This Extension is the <strong>official extension</strong> for the DataHQ Lead Enricher Apify actor, developed and maintained by DataHQ. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our data practices.</p>

        <h2>Ownership and Official Status</h2>
        <p><strong>This is the official Airtable extension for the DataHQ Lead Enricher Apify actor.</strong> DataHQ owns and operates both the extension and the underlying Apify actor infrastructure. All intellectual property, code, and services are owned by DataHQ.</p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>The Extension operates entirely within your Airtable workspace and does not collect or store any personal information on our servers. Specifically:</p>

        <h3>Data You Provide:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Airtable Data:</strong> The Extension reads company information from your selected Airtable records (company name, website, location) to perform enrichment.</li>
            <li><strong>API Keys:</strong> You provide API keys (Apify, OpenAI, Hunter.io) which are stored locally in your browser using Airtable's GlobalConfig API. These keys never leave your browser except when making API calls to the respective services.</li>
            <li><strong>Configuration Settings:</strong> Field mappings, filter preferences, and other settings are stored locally in your browser.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>Your data is used solely to provide the enrichment functionality:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Enrichment Processing:</strong> Company data from your Airtable is routed through DataHQ's secure Vercel proxy to our Apify actor for enrichment processing. The proxy ensures secure communication and does not store any data - it only routes requests to the Apify API. All enrichment processing is performed by DataHQ's Apify actor infrastructure to retrieve enriched business information (email, phone, social profiles, etc.)</li>
            <li><strong>AI Analysis:</strong> If you configure OpenAI integration, company data is sent to OpenAI's API for lead scoring and ICP matching</li>
            <li><strong>Social Profile Lookup:</strong> If you configure Hunter.io, domain information is sent to Hunter.io to find social media profiles</li>
            <li><strong>Results Storage:</strong> Enriched data is written back to your Airtable base. No copies are retained by us.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Flow Architecture</h2>
        <p><strong>Important:</strong> All data processing flows through DataHQ-owned infrastructure:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Your Airtable data is sent from the extension to DataHQ's Vercel proxy</li>
            <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> The proxy securely routes the request to DataHQ's Apify actor</li>
            <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> The Apify actor performs enrichment using various data sources</li>
            <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Enriched results are returned through the proxy to your Airtable base</li>
            <li><strong>Data Retention:</strong> DataHQ's proxy and actor infrastructure do not retain copies of your data. All data flows through our systems transiently for processing only.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> All configuration settings and API keys are stored locally in your browser using Airtable's secure GlobalConfig mechanism</li>
            <li><strong>DataHQ Infrastructure:</strong> DataHQ operates the Vercel proxy and Apify actor infrastructure through which your data flows. This infrastructure is designed for transient processing only - no copies of your data are stored on DataHQ servers.</li>
            <li><strong>Secure Transmission:</strong> All data transmitted through DataHQ's proxy to the Apify actor uses HTTPS encryption</li>
            <li><strong>Airtable Security:</strong> Your data remains within Airtable's infrastructure, protected by their security measures</li>
            <li><strong>Third-Party Services:</strong> When you use third-party APIs (OpenAI, Hunter.io), data is transmitted securely via HTTPS to those services and subject to their respective privacy policies</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>We do not share, sell, or rent your personal information. Data flows through DataHQ-owned infrastructure and is only shared with third-party services that you explicitly configure:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>DataHQ Infrastructure:</strong> All data is processed through DataHQ's Vercel proxy and Apify actor (both owned and operated by DataHQ)</li>
            <li><strong>Apify Platform:</strong> DataHQ's actor runs on the Apify platform for enrichment processing</li>
            <li><strong>OpenAI:</strong> Company data is sent for AI-powered lead scoring (only if you provide an API key)</li>
            <li><strong>Hunter.io:</strong> Domain information is sent for social profile lookup (only if you provide an API key)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
