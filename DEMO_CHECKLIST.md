## Demo Script (5 minutes)

### 🎬 Scene 1: The Problem (30 seconds)

**Say:**
> "We have leads in Airtable but missing critical data - no email, no phone, no company insights. Manual research takes 15-30 minutes per lead."

**Show:** Your Airtable table with empty fields

---

### 🎬 Scene 2: The Solution (30 seconds)

**Say:**
> "With this enrichment button, we get all that data in 60 seconds. It crawls their website, checks Google Maps, and uses AI to generate personalized outreach angles."

**Show:** The "Enrich" button in your table

---

### 🎬 Scene 3: The Demo (2 minutes)

**Do:**
1. Open a record (Harvey AI or Anthropic)
2. Click the "Enrich" button
3. **Say:** "Now it's running the enrichment actor..."
4. Show Status change to "Enriching..."
5. Open Apify console in another tab: https://console.apify.com/actors/runs
6. **Say:** "You can see the run in progress here"
7. Show the logs streaming
8. **Say:** "It's crawling the website, extracting data, and running AI analysis"
9. Wait 30-45 seconds
10. Refresh the Airtable record
11. **Show:** All the enriched fields populated!

**Highlight:**
- ✅ Email found
- ✅ Phone found
- ✅ Lead Score (0-100)
- ✅ Industry classification
- ✅ Employee count
- ✅ AI-generated summary
- ✅ Personalized outreach angles

**Read out one of the outreach angles:**
> "Reference their 25,000+ employee scale and potential LLM cost optimization needs"

---

### 🎬 Scene 4: The Value (1 minute)

**Say:**
> "This cost us $0.003 - less than a penny. Compare that to Clearbit at $0.36, ZoomInfo at $0.50+, or 15 minutes of manual research."

**Show the math:**
```
Manual Research: 15 min × $50/hr = $12.50 per lead
ZoomInfo: $0.50 per lead
Our Solution: $0.003 per lead (99.9% cheaper!)
```

**Say:**
> "And we get unique data other tools don't provide - like personalized outreach angles generated by AI specifically for your ICP."

---

### 🎬 Scene 5: Scale Demo (1 minute)

**Do:**
1. Show multiple records
2. **Say:** "You can enrich one at a time with the button, or run batch enrichment for 100 leads overnight"
3. Show the schedule configuration
4. **Say:** "Set it to run daily at 2 AM, and wake up to enriched leads every morning"

## Demo Tips

### ✅ Do's

✅ Use well-known companies (Harvey, Anthropic, OpenAI) - they have rich data
✅ Have the automation already set up and tested before the demo
✅ Keep Apify console open in another tab to show live logs
✅ Emphasize the AI-generated outreach angles - this is unique value
✅ Show the cost comparison prominently

### ❌ Don'ts

❌ Don't demo on unknown/small companies - less data available
❌ Don't skip the "what's happening" explanation - show the process
❌ Don't forget to highlight the outreach angles - this is your differentiator
❌ Don't compare only on price - emphasize unique features

---

## Fallback Plans

### If the demo fails:

**Plan A:** Have a pre-enriched record ready
- Show "before" screenshot
- Show "after" with enriched data
- Explain what happened

**Plan B:** Show Apify console logs from a previous run
- Walk through what the actor does
- Show the data being extracted
- Show the final output

**Plan C:** Show the documentation
- Walk through the setup guide
- Explain the architecture
- Schedule a follow-up when fixed

---

## Post-Demo Q&A

### Expected Questions

**Q: How long does it take?**
> A: 30-60 seconds per lead for real-time, or batch 100 leads overnight.

**Q: What if the data is wrong?**
> A: The actor extracts from public sources. You can configure which sources to use and set confidence thresholds. AI scoring is 80%+ accurate.

**Q: Can I customize the fields?**
> A: Yes, fully customizable input/output field mapping. Pick exactly what you need.

**Q: What about privacy/GDPR?**
> A: Only public data is collected. No personal data stored by the actor. All data goes directly to your Airtable.

**Q: How much does it cost?**
> A: ~$0.003 per lead. $3 per 1,000 leads. $30 per 10,000 leads. 99%+ cheaper than alternatives.

**Q: Can I use it with other CRMs?**
> A: Currently Airtable-native, but we have an API mode for integrating with any system via webhooks.

**Q: What about bulk enrichment?**
> A: Set up scheduled runs to enrich 100 leads at a time, or use the button for ad-hoc enrichment.
